Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o cyoa.o
g++    -c -o cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -std=gnu++11 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o cyoa.o
rm cyoa.o cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
