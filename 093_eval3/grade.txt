Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1  cyoa-step1.o
g++    -c -o cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step1.cpp
g++  -c cyoa.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o cyoa.o
rm cyoa.o cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
But we did not.


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
But we did not.


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 brokenstory < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Fail to open story.txt file

-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Invalid input command

-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
But we did not.


1.6: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
But we did not.
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
You indicated this was a failure, but it was not

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
You indicated this was a failure, but it was not

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1  cyoa-step1.o
The code did not compile!
